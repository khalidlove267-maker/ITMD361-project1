  <img src "jjk" alt="main three charcters from the show">
  <p>JJK is a new show that i Bingewatched four times already.</p>
 <p> This show is very graphic.</p>
 <p>Also the depths of how far the storyline goes pushes everything out the water.</p>
 
 
 <strong> ONE PUNCH MAN</strong>
  <img src "one punch man" alt="Bald Guy with Red Gloves">
 <p> This show is funny, however I dont take it serious.</p>
 <p> The Point of this show is to Point out how Characters are always favored by the writer by giving them extraordinary powers.</p>
 <p> The Main Character got his Powers by simple workouts.</p>
